# Custom printf Implementation

## Overview

This is a custom implementation of the `printf` function in C. `printf` is a standard library function used for formatted output in C, and this implementation aims to provide similar functionality.

## Features

- **Format Specifiers**: Supports a variety of format specifiers such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, `%i`, `%X`, `%%`, `%x`, and `%p`, among others.
- **Width and Precision**: Handles width and precision specifiers, allowing for precise control over output formatting.
- **Variadic Arguments**: Accepts a variable number of arguments, making it flexible for different types and numbers of arguments.
- **Standard Output**: Outputs formatted text to the standard output stream (usually the console).

## Usage

### Example:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char name[] = "John";
    
    ft_printf("Hello, %s! Your lucky number is %d.\n", name, num);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Output:

```
Hello, John! Your lucky number is 42.
```
